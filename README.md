**Please note: This program is very much still a work in progress, and will have only been tested for my specific usecase. If you lose data from using this program, that's on you. Keep backups, be smart.**

Vital Downgrader is a program written in Java, designed to take presets from the VST Vital, and downgrade them to make them compatible with older versions of the VST.

The reason for this existing comes from my college Music Technology course using machines running an older version of Vital, and needing to convert presets made on my laptop to a version that will work on their systems.
